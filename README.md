This project is an interactive web application built with React and TypeScript, featuring dynamic data fetching from a custom API. The app allows users to search for characters from a dataset, with results filtered in real-time based on the user's input. Each character is displayed with an image, name, and species, and hovering over the character's image reveals their memorable quotes in a smooth, animated tooltip.
